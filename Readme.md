# What is this repository for

MMSC-GSNI is a modified method of similarity construction and the Gaver-Stehfest numerical inversion (MMSC-GSNI) algorithm program for solving fractal composite reservoir seepage model with polynomial type elastic outer boundary conditions.

The projection contains 12 files: posimn.m, beat1.m, epsilon.m, CDE2S.m, lambda.m, r1.m, RD.m, sigma.m, df1.m, df2.m, theta1.m, and theta2.m.

posimn.m is a function file, This function is mainly used to simplify the expression of bottomhole pressure in in fractal composite reservoir seepage model with polynomial type elastic outer boundary conditions.

beat1.m, epsilon.m, CDE2S.m, lambda.m, r1.m, RD.m, sigma.m, df1.m, df2.m, theta1.m and theta2.m are all command files. Their main purposes are to use MMSC-GSNI algorithm to obtain non-dimensional bottomhole pressures and their derivatives in fractal composite reservoir seepage model with polynomial type elastic outer boundary conditions under different quadratic pressure gradients,  non-dimensional elasticity , non-dimensional skin factor and wellbore storage parameter cluster, non-dimensional coefficient lambda, non-dimensional inner radius, non-dimensional outer radius, non-dimensional parameter sigma, non-dimensional fractal dimension of the inner region, non-dimensional fractal dimension of the outer region, non-dimensional fractal index number of the inner region and  non-dimensional fractal index number of the outer region.

# TEST DATA

Command files beat1.m, epsilon.m, CDE2S.m, lambda.m, r1.m, RD.m, sigma.m, df1.m, df2.m, theta1.m and theta2.m already contain test data, which can be directly run to obtain test results.
